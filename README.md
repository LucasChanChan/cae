# Tensorflow Convolutional Auto-Encoder
### Adjusting Layers  
Layer format is like the following: ```(16)5c-(32)3c-2p```, in which ```(16)5c``` denotes convolution layer with 16 feature maps
while kernel size being set to 5. ```2p``` denotes 2 Ã— 2 pooling layer.  
### Auto-Encoder
Encoder is formed using the given layer structure. Decoder is formed using the inverse of given structure.
Note that pooling layers are converted to ```max_unpooling``` using the ```argmax``` of the pooling 
layer in the encoder. If pooling layer is not available in an encoding layer, decoder does not unpool. After unpooling -if exists- 
a new convolution layer is applied in the decoder -not deconvolution-.  

L2 losses between corresponding layers of encoder and decoder is called middle error. Recosntruction and these
errors are added to get the total loss. Gradient descent is used for backpropogation.
